# simon-says

a basic game of simon says. the objective of the game is to press buttons that match the given flashing sequence of buttons. as the game progresses the sequence increases testing the users memorization ability. 

In this game, I pair programmed using Northeastern University's GameWorld libary. These were all methods done in the classes, and we tested the methods by checkExpects which use Northeastern University's Tester libary. I was the lead programmer for the base code & interface.
